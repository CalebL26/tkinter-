## Files to run application
1. gridFile.py: File prompts the user with a graphical interface to input there name, email, and password to sign up for a "website". The application then returns the user's input from the name, email, and password in the terminal.
   
2. packFile.py: File gives the user a visual of a calculator with number 1-9 and the basic aarithmetic symbols. It also provides a decimal point. Every object has a button attatched with it but no real purpose. This is simply a display calculator.

3. placeFile.py: Gives the user the option to enter there username and password. Which is assuming the user already has an account with this website/application. Then allows the user to "login" which displays the user's input from earlier when entering the username and password data.
